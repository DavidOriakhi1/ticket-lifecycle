  Next, as an admin within osTicket, I assigned the ticket to one of the agents on the support team- 'Jane Doe'. In this case this is an emergency request with a short window of 2-4hours to close the ticket, there for the SLA was set to 'SEV-A'

<p>
Finally, after resolving the issue with Jane Doe, I closed the ticket and set the status to 'resolved' after explaining how I resolved the issue.
